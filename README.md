# The Last Dance Final Project
We were recently inspired by the documentary, ‘The Last Dance’. This docu series focuses on the 1997-98 season for Chicago -- Michael Jordan's last year with the Chicago Bulls. In addition, the series also shed some light on Jordan's head coach, Phil Jackson, and key teammates Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. 

We find this topic to be extremely relatable during these unprecedented times as American professional leagues have suspended their seasons. This is also a great opportunity to dive into non-health/medical data and further develop, enhance, and practice our coding skills. 


Analyze Michael Jordan’s college statistics, create a Predictive Model to compare the accuracy of his professional statistics. 
Create a summary of Michael Jordan’s professional statistical highlights.
Analyze 2018-2019 season statistics for a variety of teams and create a Predictive Model for the 2019-2020 season (season was suspended March 11, 2020 due to Coronavirus pandemic). 
Create linear regressions for the following: ‘Top Players’ career progression, points shot per game versus number of games played and including but not limited to defensive statistics. 
‘Top Players’ will be determined by their overall current and/or past career statistics.
Analyze ‘Top Players’ statistics to identify and create visualizations of ‘clumping’ or ‘clustering’ patterns and/or trends.
Lastly, we want to analyze how NBA games have changed throughout the decades. Are players shooting more points? Are player’s defensive statistics increasing/decreasing? What are the significant and minor trends that are apparent by visualizing the data? How can this be analyzed? What’s the baseline?
