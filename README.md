# The Last Dance Final Project Overview
We were recently inspired by the documentary, ‘The Last Dance’. This docu series focuses on the 1997-98 season for Chicago Michael Jordan's last year with the Chicago Bulls. In addition, the series also shed some light on Jordan's head coach, Phil Jackson, and key teammates Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. 

We find this topic to be extremely relatable during these unprecedented times as American professional leagues have suspended their seasons. This is also a great opportunity to dive into non-health/medical data and further develop, enhance, and practice our coding skills. 


Analyzed Michael Jordan’s college statistics, created a Predictive Model and compared it to his actual professional statistics. 
Created an overall summary of Michael Jordan’s professional statistical highlights.
Analyzed 2018-2019 season statistics for a variety of teams and created a Predictive Model for the 2019-2020 season (season was suspended March 11, 2020 due to Coronavirus pandemic). 


Created linear regressions for the following: ‘Top Players’ career progression, points shot per game versus number of games played and including but not limited to defensive statistics. ‘Top Players’ were determined by their overall current and/or past career statistics.


Analyzed ‘Top Players’ statistics to identify and create visualizations of ‘clumping’ or ‘clustering’ patterns and/or trends. 


Lastly, we analyzed how NBA games have changed throughout the decades. 

# Focus Questions
* Are players shooting more points? 
* Are player’s defensive statistics increasing/decreasing? 
* What are the significant and minor trends that are apparent by visualizing the data? 
* How can this be analyzed? 
* What’s the baseline?
